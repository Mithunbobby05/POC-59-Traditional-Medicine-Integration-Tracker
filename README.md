# POC-59 — Traditional & Complementary Medicine Integration Tracker

Real Rails POC-59 is a demonstration dashboard for exploring traditional and complementary medicine (TCM) integration across Gulf markets. It is intended for POC reviewers, health-system analysts and planners, regulators, and stakeholders considering how complementary-care services relate to conventional-care pathways. It is not clinical decision support.

> **SYNTHETIC / DEMONSTRATION DATA** — Every displayed figure is illustrative. No live healthcare sources or external healthcare APIs are connected.

## Dashboard features

- Practitioner licensing map and compliance measures by region and modality.
- Monthly usage-volume trends by modality.
- Fictional adverse-event alert examples.
- Regional licensing-compliance ranking with modality-level breakdowns.
- Synthetic stage-to-stage conventional-care referral flow.
- “Why this matters” and “Who controls the rail” context panels.
- Region, modality, time-period, and text-search controls; filtered licensing records can be exported as CSV.
- Source-quality and provenance information, including the synthetic snapshot date and intended future references.

## Technology and architecture

The project is split into two applications. The Next.js App Router page composes the dashboard components and calls the FastAPI service through typed helpers in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`. FastAPI exposes typed Pydantic responses. Synthetic fixtures live in `backend/app/data.py`; Pandas groups licensing fixtures for the regional ranking endpoint.

| Area | Technologies used |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Recharts, TanStack Table |
| Map | `react-simple-maps` and `world-atlas` |
| Reusable UI | Small local Button and Badge components using Radix Slot and class-variance-authority (shadcn/ui-style components) |
| Backend | Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn, Pandas |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **20.9 or newer** and npm. The checked-in lockfile records the Next.js engine requirement as `>=20.9.0`.
- Python **3.10 or newer**.
- Internet access during initial setup to download npm and Python packages.

The versions observed in the review environment were Node.js 22.16.0, npm 10.9.2, and Python 3.14.6. These are environment details, not pinned project versions.

## Run locally

Start the backend first, then start the frontend in a second terminal. Commands below are for PowerShell from the repository root.

### Terminal 1 — FastAPI backend

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The health endpoint is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/health](http://127.0.0.1:8000/health).

### Terminal 2 — Next.js frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The frontend API helper defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. To override it, create `frontend/.env.local` containing:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The backend CORS configuration permits the local frontend origins `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

For macOS or Linux, create the virtual environment with `python3 -m venv .venv`, activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`, then use `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000`.

## API endpoints

All dashboard endpoints are GET requests. The seven `/api` responses identify their current values as `SYNTHETIC / DEMONSTRATION DATA`.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | Reports whether the backend process is available. |
| `GET /api/dashboard/summary` | Dataset-level counts and summary source metadata. |
| `GET /api/licensing/map` | Geographic regions and licensing/compliance records by modality. |
| `GET /api/usage/trends` | Monthly usage-volume observations. |
| `GET /api/adverse-events` | Fictional adverse-event alert examples. |
| `GET /api/licensing/rankings` | Regions ranked by aggregate compliance across modalities, including counts and formula metadata. |
| `GET /api/referrals/flow` | Synthetic source-to-target pathway edges and volumes. |
| `GET /api/sources` | Provenance and intended future reference-source metadata. |

## Mock-data files

All files under `mock_data/` are labelled **SYNTHETIC DATA — NOT REAL** and are exported from the backend fixtures.

- `licensing_practitioners.csv` and `licensing_practitioners.json` — one region/modality licensing record per row, with map coordinates and compliance fields.
- `usage_volume.csv` — monthly usage-volume observations by region and modality.
- `adverse_events.csv` — fictional alert examples and statuses.
- `referral_flow.csv` — synthetic transition edges with source, target, and volume.
- `data_dictionary.md` — fields and meanings for the sample records.
- `README.md` — generation instructions and data limitations.

To regenerate these files from the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.export_mock_data
```

This command overwrites the corresponding files in `mock_data/`.

## Data limitations and future references

The licensing counts, compliance rates, usage volumes, adverse-event examples, and referral volumes are synthetic demonstrations. They are not registry extracts, observed patient or referral counts, or real clinical reports. Compliance is calculated as compliant licenses divided by total licenses, multiplied by 100, and rounded to one decimal place. Regional ranking aggregates those counts across modalities. Coverage and source freshness are not applicable to the synthetic dataset; its snapshot date is a generation date, not a source retrieval or update time.

The synthetic geographic examples are the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Qatar is included as a synthetic Gulf-market example and has no connected source in this POC. No real-world coverage claim is made.

These are intended future references only; they do not provide the current dashboard values and are not queried by the application:

- [UAE MOHAP licensing or re-licensing service for health professionals](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/w/licensing-or-re-licensing-of-health-professional) — an application service reference, not a verified public searchable complementary-medicine practitioner registry or connected data feed.
- [MOHAP Medical Professionals Directory](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/about-us/medical-professionals-directory) — a general directory; whether its search filters or records cover T&CM practitioners remains unverified.
- [MOHAP Licensed Health Workforce Data 2023](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/w/licensed-health-workforce-data_2023-1) — MOHAP describes the data by emirate, sector, professional category, nationality, and gender. The actual dataset schema and rows were not inspected, so T&CM-specific counts remain unverified.
- [Dubai Health Authority TCAM Scope of Practice guidance (August 2011)](https://dha.gov.ae/uploads/112021/8ffadaa8-95d2-42e8-8c9a-f75fcc532873.pdf) — related DHA guidance, not the POC-59-specified traditional-medicine department reports.
- [Dubai Health Investment Guide 2024](https://www.dha.gov.ae/uploads/122024/Dubai%20Health%20Investment%20Guide20241247378.pdf) — indexed extraction from printed pp. 24–25 reports that TCAM represented 1% of professionals by category in 2022 and lists 61 facilities in the “Traditional, Complementary and Alternate Medicine” category in 2022. The PDF downloaded successfully with HTTP 200 and matching file size, but the viewer timed out; the figures were not independently confirmed against rendered page images. This is a broad DHA investment guide, not a confirmed traditional-medicine department report.
- [Dubai Medical Registry](https://services.dha.gov.ae/sheryan/wps/portal/home/medical-directory) — a separate practitioner directory with a TCIM category and relevant specialty filters; it is not a department report or a connected dashboard data source.
- DHA's June 2026 TCIM survey circular invites participation but contains no survey results; it is not evidence of department findings or a qualifying report.
- [Saudi SFDA Herbal Drugs searchable product listings and registration details](https://www.sfda.gov.sa/en/herbal-drugs) — reference only; the application does not retrieve this data, and no downloadable dataset or API was verified during review.

The linked DHA PDF is the Health Regulation Department's August 2011 TCAM Scope of Practice document. It is related regulatory guidance, not the specified traditional-medicine department reports. The Dubai Health Investment Guide 2024 reports the indexed 2022 figures described above, but the PDF viewer timed out and the figures were not confirmed against rendered page images; the guide is a broad investment publication, not a confirmed department report. The Dubai Medical Registry is a separate practitioner directory, not a report. DHA's June 2026 TCIM survey circular invites participation and contains no survey results. The exact DHA traditional-medicine department report requirement remains unverified, and no DHA data integration exists. The MOHAP practitioner-licensing page is an official application service, not a verified public searchable complementary-medicine practitioner registry. MOHAP also publishes the general directory and workforce dataset linked above, but T&CM-specific directory coverage and workforce counts remain unverified. The workforce dataset description lists emirate, sector, professional category, nationality, and gender; its actual schema and rows were not inspected. No MOHAP data is connected to the dashboard, and no public practitioner data feed or API has been verified. Dashboard licensing and usage values remain synthetic. The current POC does not specify a Saudi practitioner-licensing source or a specific source for adverse-event or referral-flow values. No such source connection is implied.

## Verification status and known limitations

In the final audit on 18 October 2026, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` each passed with exit code 0. Backend health and all seven API endpoints had previously returned HTTP 200, but could not be rerun in that audit because FastAPI is not installed in the available Python environment; dependencies were not installed. Browser interactions remain user-reported rather than independently verified. No automated frontend test script or backend test suite is present in the repository.

The dashboard depends on the local FastAPI backend for data. If it is not running at the configured API address, the frontend displays an API connection error. The mock-data export command overwrites its output files. No authentication, database, deployment setup, or external data integration is included in this POC.

## Known npm audit finding

`npm audit --json` on 18 October 2026 exited 1 with five high-severity package findings associated with the single `braces` advisory [GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm), affecting `braces@3.0.3` through `micromatch` → `fast-glob` → `@next/eslint-plugin-next` → `eslint-config-next@16.3.8`. The chain is in the development dependency tree; `npm ls --omit=dev` showed none of these packages and `npm audit --omit=dev --json` reported zero findings. The advisory lists no patched `braces` version. npm's suggested remediation is a major downgrade of `eslint-config-next` to 14.2.35, which was not applied because compatibility with the project's Next.js 16.3.8 setup is unverified. No dependency fix was applied. The finding remains unresolved; its development-only location does not establish that the application is secure or that the issue cannot affect production.
